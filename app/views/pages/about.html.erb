        Hello everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
        This is Lea Schumacher and Marianna Venardou, two friends that welcome you to our first, joined, non-profit Christmas project!
        </p>
        <p>
        Our goal is simply to cheer people up during these dark times and especially during holidays when things might seem even darker and lonelier.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lea Schumacher came up with the original idea and coded the website, while Marianna Venardou wrote the story drawing inspiration from Tchaikovskyâ€™s music.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please enjoy!
        </p>
        <p>
        We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
        </p>
